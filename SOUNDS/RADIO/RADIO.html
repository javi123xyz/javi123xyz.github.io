						<span>During the 2017-2018academic year, I had the privilege of working as an intern with UCI's student radio news team. Every week, I would produce a new, professional-quality radio segment that took an in-depth look at a specific topic or story, ranging from domestic politics to international events, environmental news to pop culture, and everything in between. The segments would air weekly on the Pulp News show on 88.9 FM. Producing these segments often required extensive research, attending events to gather soundbytes and talk to people, and communicating with professors and other experts for interviews. Aside from helping me better develop my narrative and journalistic skills, this internship also taught me how to use professional-grade audio equipment as well as audio engineering software such as Adobe Audition, Audacity, and Ableton.</span>

								<h3>Northern California Wildfires - <em>October 23, 2017</em></h3>
								<p>
								California and wildfires, unfortunately, go together like fine wine and cheese. The state suffers from a bout of destructive fires nearly every year and 2017 was no different. In this episode, I discuss the effects of climate change in fueling these fires, the destruction they caused, and what steps are being taken to mitigate future fire risks.

								In this episode, I discussed the semi-autonomous Spanish region of Catalonia. In particular, I covered the independence movement which intensified in late 2017 after the passage of a popular referendum that would official declared the region's secession from Spain. My friend Joel, who studied abroad in Barcelona, the heart of Catalonia, joined me this episode and talked about his experience living in the region during the latest flare-up of the Catalan independence movement.

								<h3>Affordable Housing Crisis in Irvine - <em>November 6, 2017</em></h3>
								<p>
								Property values in California are some of the highest in the nation, contributing greatly to the state's ongoing housing insecurity crisis. This problem is greatly pronounced in the Orange County, where rent and mortgage prices greatly outweigh the average worker's wages. In this episode, I discuss the opening of Irvine's first affordable appartment complex, Anton Portola, and what it means for Irvine and the surrounding communities. David Snow, distinguished professor of sociology, joined me that week to discuss the extent of the Orange County's housing crisis best approaches to alleviate it.

								<h3>Tropicalia 2017 - <em>November 13, 2017</em></h3>
								<p>
								Gorgeous seafront views, a motley of musical acts, and a selection of the finest tacos in the state. The Tropicalia music festival was a unique experience that managed to bridge the various incongruent pieces that make up my personality, so I had to attend it for myself. I covered the event for KUCI News' OC Pop segment and managed to score a VIP pass which got me closer to the performers and front of the line privileges at the taco stands.

								Robert Mugabe, long-time dicator of the African country of Zimbabwe, stepped down from power on November 27, 2017 after nearly four decades in power. Mugabe's reign was marred with human rights abuses, corruption, and electoral fraud. I discuss the impact that Mugabe had on the counry of Zimbabwe and post-colonial Africa in general and what his retirement will mean for the country.

								<h3>Turmoil in Honduras - <em>December 4, 2017</em></h3>
								<p>
								The 2017 Honduran general election was marred with controversy and violence. Many Honduran and international election watchdogs were alarmed at the various instances of election  fraud and voter suppression that took place. Protests broke out against incumbent President Juan Orlando Hernández, who defied the Honduran constitution by running (and winning) a second term in office. Protestors criticized Orlando Hernández for his alleged corruption and state-sponsored violence. I discuss the country's history of political turmoil and make some predictions on how this upheaval will fuel migration out of the country.

								<h3>The Orange County Housing Crisis (Fall 2017 Final Project) - <em>December 18, 2017</em></h3>
								<p>
								For my first final project fo UCI, I teamed up with my fellow KUCI interns Helena, Orbelin, and Natalie to create an in-depth analysis of the Orange County housing crisis. We explored the causes of the situation and highlight the strengths and limitations of community and governmental efforts to address it. This involved interviewing a person personally affected by the housing crisis and also experts in the field to gain a holistic understanding of the issue.

								<h3>President Donald Trump: One Year Later - <em>January 22, 2018</em></h3>

								President Trump's first year in office has been plagued with scandal, controversy, and misfortune. On the eve of the one year anniversary of his innauguration, I review his most memorable personal actions and legislative accomplishments and the ramifications they will have on the future of our nation. I also discuss the allegations brought forward by adult actor Stormi Daniels against Trump.

								<h3>Hip Hop's Deadly Drug Cultrure - <em>January 29, 2018</em></h3>
								<p>
								Chicagon rapper Fredo Santana became the lastest figure in the hip hop community to tragically die at the hands of illicit drugs. Though his music and others like it often glorifies the very same drug usage that claimed his life, I discuss the deeper root causes of hip hop's infatuation with drugs and the implications it has on the behaviors of their listeners. I also use hip hop's drug culture to analyze the current opioid crisis the United States is undergoing.

								<h3>Chinese Hip Hop - <em>February 5, 2018</em></h3>
								<p>
								Rap and hip hop grew from the fringes of society to become major staples of American culture. This dominance of the genre is not contained to the United States, however. Other countries have also developed their own versions of hip hop which borrows from American culture and incorporates local sounds. China, in particular, has developed quite the fledging hip hop scene. However, in early 2018, the Chinese government began to crack down on Chinese hip hop and rappers, taking down their online videos and even threatening entertainers with imprisonment. I discussed the spread of hip hop culture to China and their government's efforts to censure it and manifestations of other outside cultures. I also highlight how this mirrored efforts by the United States government to censure "gangsta" rap artists like N.W.A.

								<h3>Abuse of Power at Baltimore Police Department - <em>February 12, 2018</em></h3>
								<p>
								The topic of police brutality is one that . The Baltimore Police Department, in specific, has been one of the most notorious police departments in the country, with several allegations of evidence fabrication, brutality, drug dealing, extortion, and other improper behaviors plauging the department. The death of Freddie Gray at the hands of Baltimore police officers in 2015 drew a lot of national attention to the devious actions of the BPD and helped mobilize major grassroot efforts to demand reform. This week, I discuss the investigations into the Baltimore Police Department and how they reveal a larger, starker trend of police departments across the country.

								<h3>Cryptocurrencies &amp; the Environment - <em>February 19, 2018</em></h3>
								<p>
								Cryptocurrency markets exploded in 2018 following the dramatic rise in bitcoin prices in later 2017/early 2018. Cryptocurrencies became the newest hot topic of discusssion, with major crypto proponents promising that blockchain technology would revolutionize our monetary system and the very fundamentals of how we live. Yet one of the aspects of cryptocurrensies that is often overlooked is its impact on the envirnonment. In this episode, I discuss the environmental harm caused by bitcoin mining and transactions, but also the potential for using blockchain technology to reduce greenhouse emissions and combat climate change.

								<h3>Massacre at Parkland High School - <em>February 26, 2018</em></h3>

								The Parkland Shooting was the latest in a sad history of public school mass shootings to have struck the United States in the past few years. While the topics of gun control and mental health were brought up once again, little substantive progress seem to have emerged from this tragedy. However, the Parkland massacre also galvanized an entire group of high school students across the nation to mobilize themselves and demand action on school shootings. I discuss their efforts and the response from politicians and the general public in this episode.

								<h3>Sanctuary Cities vs Trump - <em>April 16, 2018</em></h3>
								<p>
								Donald Trump has made his disdain for immigrants clear since the very beginning of his campaign, where he denounced Mexican immigrants as drug dealers, criminals, and rapists. His administration has ramped up efforts to crack down on both illegal and legal migration, but they have met resistance from local and state governments which have proclaimed they will not aid their efforts. In this episode, I discuss these so-called sanctuary cities and states. I also examine the several Orange County cities which have opted to side with the Trump administration rather than the state of California's government.

								<h3>2018 Inter-Korean Summit - <em>April 28, 2018</em></h3>
								<p>
								Under the leadership of Kim Jong-Un, North Korea became a nuclear state--much to the chagrin of the United States and its regional partners. Yet Kim experienced an apperant change of heart in early 2018 as relations between North and South Korea warmed. An inter-Korean summit occured in May. I talked with Robert Uriu, a professor of political science and East Asian relations at UC Irvine, that week to discuss the turn of events and what the summit meant for the future of North Korea.

								<h3>Controvery at the 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner - <em>May 7, 2018</em></h3>
								<p>
								The 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner lacked a vital element that nearly all of its previous iterations had: the president. Though Donald Trump loves to dish out insults, he appears to not be able to withstand them himself. Lucky for him, because host Michelle Wolf really went in on Trump and his administration, even receiving some backlash for her comments. I discuss how humor can be utilized as a lens to interpret politics and why it is especially important in modern times. I also explore the double standard in regards to criticism on Michelle Wolf's comments and silence on Donald Trump's.

								<h3>Toxic Masculinity and Public Displays of Mass Violence - <em>May 28, 2018</em></h3>

								Only a few months after the Parkland massacre, another mass shooting claimed several victims at a Santa Fe, New Mexico high school. Though much of the discussion surrounding these mass shootings have revolved around access to guns, one of the prevailing themes that is often gleamed over is that of toxic masculinity. This week, I discussed how its defined, how it drives some men to violence, and what steps can be taken to promote non-toxic masculinity.

								This was my final, final project for my KUCI internship. I teamed up with another KUCI intern, Toni Cruz, to tackle the topic of gender double standards in modern American society. We went around UC Irvine and asked students what their thoughts were on gender double standards. I also spoke with UCI physics and astronomy Professor Mu-Chun Chen and my friend Kylie to discuss the gender disparity in the STEM field, one of the places where it is the most prominent. I incorporate elements from my earlier discussion on toxic masculinity and also explore other related topics.
