				<span><h2>Portfolio Updates</h2></span>
				<span>&#9656;Whenever I update this portfolio significantly with new content, layout, or functionality, those changes will be documented here to keep all my visitors updated with my latest work.</span>
				<span>&#9656;July 10, 2019: I am currently in the process of uploading new content from my final year at UC Irvine. There's a lot of stuff I have to parse through. So far, I have updated my graphics and designs. Next up is my written work, 3D objects, photography, memes, and hopefully fixing some of the site errors I have found since I've launched this website. I also hope to put some data visualization up on the portfolio, but I might just wait until the end of the year for that, so keep your eyes open for that! I will make an announcement on my social medias as things are updated and repaired, so please be patient!</span>
				<span>&#9656;October 28, 2019: I finalized some recent updates and changes I have been making ob my portfolio over the past month or so. I updated some of the visual elements of my portfolio and added new content as always. I restructured some things to optimize loading speeds. This includes my musical work and 3D objects, which are finally and easily accessible now. I'll probably continue making minor tweaks and adjustments through the rest of 2019.</span>
				<span>&#9656;October 7, 2020: Lots of changes, two major ones. I registered the javiersolis.org domain and also uploaded my portfolio to GitHub to allow for easier, more streamlined access to my content. This also included removing a lot of unused and inefficient code (mostly CSS styling) and making the website more responsive to the users' device. More content has been added to my visual, written, and 3D work. I also made some slight changes to the layout/background of the portfolio. I hope these changes amplify the end user experience.</span>
				<span>&#9656;February 5, 2021: New year, new updates. Added a lot of new graphics I made and more 3D stuff. Tweaked some styling to make it more consitent across pages. HTTPS is finally active, meaning that you can browse my portfolio with ease of mind. This also means I will be able to add more features soon, so keep an eye out for that!</span>
				<span>&#9656;November 2021: javiersolis.org celebrates its 1-year anniversary! I thought a facelift was in order, so I changed the color scheme a bit and made some other minor changes to the aesthetic. I also added more contentn which I have made recently. Look out for more to come next year!</span>
