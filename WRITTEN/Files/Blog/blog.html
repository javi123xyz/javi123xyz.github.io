			<h2>Brief Musings on the 2020 election</h2>
			<h3>by Javier Solis</h3>
			<h4>November 2, 2020</h4>
			<div class="blogText">
				<p>
				It's the day before election day. A lot has been said about Donald Trump's first term in office, a lot will be said, and a lot needs to be said. Personally, it has been difficult to find the words to accurately and succinctly sum up my feelings and thoughts for the past four years. I wanted to add to the cacophonous discourse, however small and inconsequential my contribution may seem, if for nothing else - for posterity and future reflection.
				</p>
				<p>
				When Donald Trump first announced his candidacy in his gilded Trump tower, it was hard to take him seriously. He had (and still has) the incoherent ramblings of an out of touch oligarch, a sordid history of past misconduct (including, but not limited to: multiple sexual allegations, harassment a motley of failed or highly corrupt business dealings, various instances of discriminatory behavior and remarks, and an utter disregard and often contempt for people who are not him), and a dystopian outlook on the future of this country. Yet none of this mattered to the millions of people who voted and fervently supported him. They marched to the polls believing in his promise to “Make America Great Again”. They were fooled.
				</p>
				<p>
				A combination of distrust towards the neoliberal regime of the past several decades, deeply embedded misogynist, racist, nationalist, and xenophobic attitudes, and a prevailing culture of rugged individualism and willful ignorance helped Donald Trump defy all the odds, all the pollsters, even his own expectations, and lead his team to victory. Historians and political scientists for decades (perhaps centuries) to come will wax and wane about why Trump won, but the trajectory upon which his first term in office has set us is undeniably disastrous. Trump has undermined our status on the international stage by chastising allies and cozying up to adversaries. Trump has needlessly and cruelly caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people by mismanaging a pandemic response. Trump has ripped apart hundreds of immigrant families apart, forever scaring the minds of these young children. Trump has accelerated the destruction of our environment by denying climate science and erasing environmental regulations. Trump has inflated the pockets of his wealthy friends, his family, and himself at the expense of the working class. Trump has ripped open the wounds of racial tension in America by constantly flirting with far-right and white supremacists groups while degrading black protestors as terrorists and sons of bitches. Trump has rolled back protections for the LGBTQ community, endangering the safety and wellbeing of one queer brothers and sisters. Trump has openly displayed his objectification of women and his hatred of powerful women who do not bow down to him. Trump has … This is getting repetitive. Many people, arguably smarter than I, have compiled several lists of all the actions Trump has done, abetted, or influenced to a significant degree, so to rehash them all would be moot.	
				</p>
				<p>
				To quote Lenin "there are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen". This is Trump’s four years in office epitomized. Every week if not every day was a new development, a new scandal, crooked dealing, nefarious executive order, or other rotten node added to wretched, complex web of maleficence Trump has wrapped this country in. It’s exhausting. It’s absurd, I feel like I took too much Benadryl on election night 2016 and have just been on a bad disassociate tip ever since. Despite all the long-term damage and insanity, it almost doesn’t reel real. Almost.
				</p>
				<p>
				I’m going to be brief and not beat a dead horse. It’s my day off and I have other things to waste my time on rather than putting myself in a depressive state over the reality of the past one years, so I want to end by saying this: Donald Trump must resoundingly lose tomorrow. Any tricks his campaign employs to steal this election must be countered thoroughly. Just to be clear, neither Joe Biden, nor Kamala Harris, nor any other politician in this country will save us. The onus rests upon us as collective individuals to organize, provide for, and advocate for each other. The fight does not and cannot end with defeating Donald Trump. There is much work that needs to be done to repair the damage caused and, more importantly, ensure it never happens again.
