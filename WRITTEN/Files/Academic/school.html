					<span>Throughout my collegiate career both at Allan Hancock College (2015 - 2017) and UC Irvine (2017 - 2019)
					, I have had to write numerous essays, create various infographics, and compose several research reports for class requirements. I believe that writing samples and assingments are often a better indicator of comprehension and dexterity in a subject matter than letter grades are. I take pride in the work that I do for academic purposes and I believe that it shows clearly in its quality. I chose the following assingments because I believe they accurately showcase my versatility as a writer, my synthesis skills, and also my intellectual and analytical growth as a scholar. </span>

							This assingment instructed us to play the role of an entry-level analyst for a multinational oil company. We had to chose a major oil-producing nation and write an assesment of whether or not it would be wise to invest in the country's oil sector. This assesment included an analysis of the country's history and politics, their exports and other economic measures, and required us to make our own original charts and graphs to support our assesment. I chose the Latin American country of Venezuela for my assesment.

We had to do extensive research on the country's history, politics, and current events and had to compile our own charts and graphs.

The second part is a brief outline which touts the strengths and weaknesses ofthe East Asian model compared to the alternatives of the so-called Washington Consensus. For our class final, we were broken up into small groups and had a debate where one side criticized the East Asian model while the other supported it.

							Our USFPEA class was divided into three different groups, representing the U.S. Department of State, Department of Commerce, and Department of Defense. Our goal was to write an extensive report which outlined American interests and background issues in the Southeast Asia region. This report served as a basis for a policy simmulation our class conducted towards the end of the quarter. I was part of the Department of State and was in charge of the "Regional Issues" section of the report as well as parts of "Economic Institutions and Trade" section, namely the "Asia Development Bank," "Trans-Pacific Partnership," and "Economic Challenges" subsections. I also editted the report for grammar and diction, conciseness, and overall structure.

							For our USFPEA final, our class was divided in half, with one half representing the United States government and the other representing the Chinese government. We were further divided into subsections representing the different state departments or ministries of each country and I was assinged to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. We wrote a report about our stance on several US-Chinese disputes, including the trade deficit, North Korea's nuclear threat, the South China Sea, and the issue of Taiwanese sovereignty. We discussed this in our final class with the American team to try and come up with mock policy proposals that would satisfy both sides. Though we came to some agreement on North Korea, we had major disagreements on the issue of intellectual property, the trade deficit, and tariffs.

							For my American culture class, I wrote a literature review-style research paper on American food culture. I explored the history of American food and eating habits, the effects of governmental policy on food culture, and popular media depictions of food and the socialization of children into American food culture, among other topics. I don't want to spoil it too much, so feel free to read the introduction, or at least the abstract. I'm not one to typically brag, but this is perhaps the best work I have produced thus far. I put in a lot of reading, writing, and brain racking to put it all together and it paid off, as I received a 49/50 and high praise from my professor for it.

							One of the final classes I took at UC Irvine was a research methods class in which we had to prepare and conduct an ethnographic research project on a topic of our chosing. I decided to research internet meme culture and its influence on the political ideologies of individuals who partake in that culture--specifically, among fringe right-wing groups. As part of this project, I conducted two sets of in-depth interviews with two different subjects to gauge their involvement in internet meme culture as well any effects this participation has on their sociopolitical beliefs. I also conducted a survey of a subset of UC Irvine's student population via Google Forms as part of my research and the responses can be found here: https://1drv.ms/x/s!Asel2_0qVl-ctVsGZlPSz7wVR73O?e=EaO7RV
