						<span>When I was a senior in high school (2013-2014), I founded the open source politics and current events blog <em>In Loco Politicio</em> as part of a project for my AP English class. It soon became a full-fledged pursuit of mine and I began posting at least once or twice a month. Though I have had other fellow colleagues and friends of mine guest author an article on the site, I did the bulk of the writing, administration, and outreach for <em>In Loco Politico</em>. I have written on national, state, and international events and politics as well as even doing some humorous and satirical pieces. Unfortunately, I haven't updated the website since early 2017 because of conflicts with work, school, and other pursuits. Below is a small selection of the work that I would publish on the site. They link back to the actual website itself where you can see other posts as well.</span>

						<h1>GASOLINAZO 2017: MEXICAN GAS CRISIS</h1>
						<h3>January 7, 2017</h3>
						<p>In his 2014 new year's address to the nation, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto announced that his administration would enact various measures to revitalize the sluggish Mexican economy, including plans to reduce the price of electric energy and put an end to the dreaded gasolinazo, the monthly increases of gasoline prices. They would accomplish this tremendous feat by privatizing parts of the state-owned oil company, Pemex, and allowing the free market to determine the price of petroleum rather than having the government set it as they have for the past seven decades.</p>

						<h1>THE KREMLIN PRESIDENT</h1>
						<h3>December 18, 2016</h3>
						<p>Over fifty years ago, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy rose to prominence after claiming he had an extensive list of “members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring” that were working for the US State Department. Though McCarthy’s accusations were largely unfounded, our country became paranoid that foreign entities had infiltrated the highest levels of American government and had secretly influenced our democracy for the better part of the 20th century.

						In contemporary times, however, the notion that these groups have interfered in our democracy has been largely scoffed at and dismissed. But after a century of interfering in the democratic elections of other countries, the United States is finally receiving a taste of its own medicine.</p>

						<h1>MEME ELECTION 2016</h1>
						<h3>November 5, 2016</h3>
						<p>Los Angeles-based artist and illustrator Matt Furie woke up one morning to find that one of his beloved creations, a green anthropomorphic frog named Pepe, had been denounced by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as a “symbol associated with white supremacy“. Furie was somewhat befuddled that his beloved creation had been hijacked by the so-called alt-right–a movement that has been defined by the Southern Poverty Law Center as “a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‘white identity’ is under attack by multicultural forces using ‘political correctness’ and ‘social justice’ to undermine white people and ‘their’ civilization”.</p>

					  <h1>HARAMBER: A FALLEN COMRADE & MARTYR</h1>
						<h3>August 28, 2016</h3>
						<p>It was the day after Harambe’s 17th birthday when a three-year-old child climbed over a protective fence and tumbled into the moat surrounding the gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. An inquisitive Harambe saw the child flailing around in the shallow water, as if he were injured. Harambe, being the good-natured western lowland gorilla that he is, decided to reach out and help this poor child. Immediately upon making contact with the small human, however, the other humans standing above began shouting at Harambe, agitating and confusing him in the process. Believing that these humans posed a threat to the safety and security of the young child, Harambe grabbed the boy and dragged him away to safety. Just moments after, a single shot rang out from a sniper’s rifle and pierced Harambe’s body, causing the once-mighty gorilla to lay withering in a pool of his own warm, scarlet blood as the eternal oblivion slowly consumed him.</p>

						<h1>GUNS, GOD, AND FREEDOM: THE AMERICAN WAY</h1>
						<h3>October 8, 2015</h3>
						<p>Our great country of ours, the United States of America, was founded on a few basic principles that have survived the test of time. Those basic principles were outlined in our constitution and further detailed in the Bill of Rights, which is basically our version of the Ten Commandments except a lot more secular. Other countries might also have freedom of speech and the press, but few have given their citizens the right to bear arms and form armed militias. The Second Amendment, however, does exactly that, and is widely hailed as one of the reasons the US is the greatest country on God’s green earth.</p>

						<h1>SOLIDARITY WITH STANDING ROCK</h1>
						<h3>September 6, 2016</h3>
						<p>At the onset of summer 2016, a group of dedicated, young activists from the Standing Rock Native American Reservation in North Dakota embarked on a harrowing fifteen-hundred mile journey all the way to Washington DC– on foot. Their mission was to deliver a petition with over 140,000 signatures to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, asking them to deny a permit to the Texas-based company Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) which plans on building an oil and natural gas pipeline that cuts underneath their water supply and ancestral lands. The $3.7 billion Bakken Oil Pipeline, better known as the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), would stretch over a thousand miles from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to another pipeline in Illinois, which transfers oil to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico and Eastern United States. The non-profit organization Earthjustice filed suit against the US Army Corps of Engineers on behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at the end of July, accusing the corps of violating the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 among other laws.</p>

						<h1>FOR DEANNA BYRNE: TEACHER, MENTOR, & FRIEND</h1>
						<h3>August 22, 2015</h3>
						<p>OIt is said that a good teacher is much like the candles we held in our hands that night: they consume themselves to help light the way for others. Deanna did just that. She dedicated her life to brightening the lives of others. She was one of the few remaining teachers that truly cared about the success and personal well-being of every single one of her students. Whenever a student seemed down on their luck, or was doing poorly in her class, Deanna made sure to talk to that student, find out what’s wrong, and try to do everything in her power to help them succeed. She went above and beyond her duties as a teacher, thus gaining the title of mentor, role model, and close friend to many of her current and former students.</p>

						<h1>BALTIMORE ENGULFED IN RIOTS AFTER DEATH OF FREDDIE GRAY </h1>
						<h3>April 29, 2015</h3>
						<p>Massive riots and civil disobedience have engulfed the City of Baltimore, Maryland a week after the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray at the hands of the Baltimore Police Department. Images of burning buildings, teargas-flooded streets, and rioters throwing rocks at riot gear-clad police officers filled both social media and news outlets Monday afternoon.</p>

						<h1>¡VIVOS SE LOS LLEVARON, VIVOS LOS QUEREMOS!</h1>
						<h3>November 21, 2014</h3>
						<p>On September 26th, over 100 students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teachers College of Ayotzinapa in the state of Guerrero, Mexico traveled to the nearby town of Iguala in order to protest. The students were angered that government founding practices favored urban colleges as opposed to rural colleges; students from inner-city colleges were also much more likely to get hired. The student protests coincided with a conference hosted by María de los Ángeles Pineda Villa, wife of Iguala’s mayor José Luis Abarca Velázquez, in order to celebrated her public works and to promote her campaign to be Iguala’s next mayor. The students were also planning on soliciting transportation to Mexico City in order to participate in the annual march to commemorate the 1968 student massacre in Tlatelolco. The students, however, never made it because they were stopped by the Iguala municipal police shortly after.</p>

						<h1>CHIRAQ: AMERICA'S MURDER CAPITAL</h1>
						<h3>January 29, 2014</h3>
						<p>It was briefly before the summer of 2012 when then 16 year-old rapper Chief Keef (birth name Keith Cozart) burst into the “drill” music scene. While being confined to his grandmother’s house under house arrest for previous weapons charges, Sosa (as he’s commonly referred as) release three songs onto his YouTube account: “Bang“, “3hunna“, and “Don’t Like. “Don’t Like” quickly became a hometown banger that attracted the likes of fellow Chicago rapper Kanye West. West, along with GOOD music members Pusha T, Big Sean, and 2 Chainz, made a remix to the hit and included it in the collective’s debut album. Soon, Keef quickly burgeoned into the limelight. He had various record labels courting him as well as having many heavy hitters in the rap industry either be featured on his songs or feature him in theirs. Chief Sosa would eventually settle for a multi-million, three album deal with Interscope.</p>
